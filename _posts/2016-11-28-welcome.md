## Let's Talk

It has only been 20 days since the last Presidential election in the United States.

During the election process, holes in our Democratic Republic became more apparent.

* The power of the American voter has been stripped away.
* Our politicians no longer represent us.
* The voice of the once respected and powerful media has been silenced.
* Our country is committing crimes against humanity at home and abroad.
* Only the poor and middle class are paying taxes. Those taxes are not being used for our benefit.
* We are exposed to more lies than truths.
* __We are being turned against each other to maintain the status quo.__

Our aim is to unite the American people so we can fix the problems in Washington. We cannot wait any longer for those in power to do this for us. They have had plenty of time, and they have failed.

Let's talk.
