  <h1 class="page-title">Rules of Engagement</h1>
  <p>Debating in the online space can be a healthy and exciting way of expressing our opinions. However, technology has advanced faster than society can keep up.</p>

<p>We have had centuries to set the rules for personal human interaction; etiquette, manners, and courtesy. In the online space it has merely been a couple of decades. In the digital world, people remain anonymous and debates can quickly turn nasty. This is not a solid framework for productive conversations that move our country forward.</p>

<p class="message">
The Rules of Engagement aims to set a basic outline for debate correspondence online. By including a link to the rules in our social media profiles, we can quickly inform others that we intend to express ourselves respectfully. By doing so, we pledge to ourselves and others to abide by the following rules.
</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="accountable">Accountable</h2>

<p><strong>I will express my views as myself.</strong> I will display a proper name and photograph to indicate to others who I am. I will not be embarrassed to take ownership of my views and put my identity behind them.</p>

<p><strong>I will block, mute, ignore, or un-friend anyone who conceals their identity.</strong> I will not converse with people who choose to conceal their identity. I understand that anonymity can embolden others to present false information and display aggression beyond their usual capacity.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="truthful">Truthful</h2>

<p><strong>I will not share or disperse information if I am uncertain of the origin.</strong> I will take the time to find the source of the information and verify it is legitimate.</p>

<h3 id="tips-for-establishing-legitimacy">Tips for Establishing Legitimacy:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The date of the source is correctly associated with the topic of discussion.</li>
  <li>The source has a verifiable author, staff, or editorial structure.</li>
  <li>The source is not a search engine or social network.</li>
  <li>If the source is a graphic/meme, it includes a verifiable credit for the creator or origin.</li>
</ul>

<p>I will read articles (in full) before sharing or commenting on the headline. I understand that context, source, and medium may factor into the validity of the article contents.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="respectful">Respectful</h2>

<p><strong>I will speak respectfully and politely to everyone.</strong> I will not demean, degrade, or attempt to humiliate through derogatory name-calling or abusive language.</p>

<p><strong>I will block, mute, ignore, or un-friend anyone that attempts to call me a derogatory name.</strong> I understand this is a way to derail a productive conversation and refuse to participate.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="patriotic">Patriotic</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I am a US citizen or resident tax-payer with a vested interest in the betterment of my country.</li>
  <li>I have fully read, comprehend, and abide by <a href="http://www.senate.gov/civics/constitution_item/constitution.htm">The Constitution of The United States of America</a>.</li>
  <li>I understand that The United States of America is comprised of <strong>50 States</strong> and that all citizens have <strong>equal</strong> say.</li>
  <li>My intention is lend my voice to the improvement of The United States of America.</li>
  <li>I have a willingness to understand the viewpoints of my fellows citizens that is as powerful as my desire to express my own.</li>
  <li>I understand and appreciate that no American citizen is more or less American than any another, regardless of race, location, viewpoint, or background.</li>
