title: About Us
---
We are not an organization. __We do not accept donations or monetary compensation.__ We require little to no funding to operate.
<p class="message">
There is no membership. As an American citizen, in a way, you are already a member.
</p>
We do not collude with political parties, governments, or the media. American Discourse is not liberal, conservative, or anything in between. Our thought contributors have wide-ranging personal viewpoints but they express themselves outside of this group.

Our goal is simple. Provide a framework for productive conversation so the American people can work together and regain control of our country.

If you believe in what we are doing and would like to contribute, please email <therebellion@protonmail.com>
