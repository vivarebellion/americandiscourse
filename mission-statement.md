title: Mission Statement
---

Dictators and fascists seize power using using one of the world’s most proven tools; branding. Slogans, logos, and catchy names empower politicians and movements. It is Coke vs. Pepsi, but the stakes are much higher.

We further their goals by strengthening their brand. We add fuel to their movement by reacting.

<p class="message">
  Our approach to revolution is non-violent. We aim to weaken the brand of the power-hungry and strengthen the brand of the people.

## Action vs. Reaction

Reaction is exhausting. Rage is exhausting. Are people strong enough to keep reacting?

Some are, but many will succumb to the power and inevitably give in. Once exhaustion gives way to acceptance, their apathy strengthens the brand.

* We do not react. We act.
* We respond to hate with kindness.
* We combat ignorance with understanding.
* We don’t fight the evil that holds power. We empower the good to seize it from them.

We are proactive and diligent in our efforts to support the people and organizations who seek to bring us peace.

__We reject and ignore those who divide us.__

## Non-Violence

Rage gives way to violence. Violence instigates the use of violent force to contain it. The use of force intimidates the people and strengthens the brand of those in power.

If we use violence, we give them an excuse for suppression. We alienate the peaceful people we need the most.

> Non-violence is the greatest force at the disposal of mankind. It is mightier than the mightiest weapon of destruction devised by the ingenuity of man. - Mahatma Gandhi

## Is America Great Yet?

When the definition of a great America is embraced by less than half of the population, then America will never be great. America will only be truly great when the overwhelming majority is in agreement.

Our current government was established long before technology opened up the lines of communication nationally. We are represented by regional politicians who refuse to work with each other and rarely poll the public for our input. Voting is archaic, complex, and restrictive.

We believe 1 person = 1 vote. The people should be empowered to not only elect officials, but to lend their vote for or against policies that affect the nation.

## Declaration of Shared Values

__Non-Partisan:__ Political parties are for politicians, not voters. We do not accept a set of values or ideals because it falls in line with party norms.

__Inclusive:__ All people are equal regardless of race, gender, or economic conditions.

We are calling on politicians to withdraw from their parties and declare independence. Only politicians who are untethered from the system can truly represent the people.
